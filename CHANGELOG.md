# 3.0.0

- Seriously improved how the messages are formatted. There's a lot more there, but it's awesome.

# 2.0.1

- Returning the message from apiCheck.warn/throw. Though, if an error is actually thrown, then any responding code to the returned message will not run...

# 2.0.0

- Major internal api changes. All checkers now return an error like React's `propTypes` and the messaging has been improved.

# 1.0.1

- Updating readme

# 1.0.0

- Initial release. Enjoy :-)
